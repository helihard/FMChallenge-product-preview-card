## Overview

Dipping my toes in the waters of responsivity. Mobile - straight forward and easy. Getting the design to look good on desktop, on the other hand, required some thinking. Would probably have made different adjustments had the challenge not explicitly stated that the product should look "as close to the design as possible".
